Life expectency model:The World Health Organization (WHO)â€™s Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository tracks life expectancy for countries worldwide by following health status and many other related factors.
In this project, we will design, train, and evaluate a neural network model performing the task of regression to predict the life expectancy of countries using this dataset.
